# Make incremental builds fast for easy development

If you are developing a Node.js library, use [ts-node-dev](https://github.com/whitecolor/ts-node-dev) for fast incremental rebuilds. It bundles [ts-node](https://github.com/TypeStrong/ts-node) together with [nodemon](https://github.com/remy/nodemon). It also watches your `tsconfig.json` for changes which makes prototyping easy and fast.
